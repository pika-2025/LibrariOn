# Library Management System â€“ Version 2

This is the second version of my Library Management System project. In this version, I have implemented a modern web application using **Flask** for the backend and **JavaScript** modules for the frontend, providing a more interactive and dynamic user experience.

- **Modular Codebase:** Organized JavaScript files for components, pages, and utilities.
